Visualisation of author collaborations

The collaborations package analyses the author collaborations in an EPrints repository 
and visualises them on an interactive wheel. The author collaboration network graphs are 
processed with a script and saved as XML files. The graphs are visualised using 
ProcessingJS. The network visualisation can be classified as radial 
convergence according to the typology used by Manuel Lima (Visual Complexity,
Mapping Patterns of Information, Princeton, NY, 2011, ISBN 978-1-56898-936-5). 

The package consists of 
- a script and plugin to generate the graph files
- a cgi script and screen plugin for the visualisation
- the ProcessingJS program (including the Processing source files) to visualise the
  collaboration XML graph files
- some JavaScript helper code
- phrase files in English and German
